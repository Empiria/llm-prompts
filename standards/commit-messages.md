## üö® CRITICAL COMMIT MESSAGE REQUIREMENTS üö®

**ABSOLUTELY NO AI REFERENCES IN COMMITS - EVER!**

‚ùå **NEVER INCLUDE:**
- "Generated with Claude Code"
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude" 
- Any mention of AI, Claude, assistants, or automated generation
- References to code generation tools
- Any footers with AI attribution

‚úÖ **ALWAYS:**
- Write commits as if the human developer authored them completely
- Use only the standard conventional commit format with emoji + type + description + body
- Include only legitimate co-authorship (actual human collaborators)
- Keep commit messages authentic and human-authored

**EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:**
```
‚ùå BAD: Added new feature

ü§ñ Generated with [AI Tool](https://example.com)
Co-Authored-By: AI Assistant <noreply@example.com>
```

**CORRECT FORMAT:**
```
‚úÖ GOOD: ‚ú® feat(auth): add two-factor authentication support

- implement TOTP-based 2FA using authenticator apps
- add backup recovery codes for account recovery
- integrate with existing user management system

Closes #245
```
